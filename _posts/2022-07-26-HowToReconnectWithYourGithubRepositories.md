- If needed sign in at https://github.com On the right-hand side of the screen click on the Menu button and Select Settings
- From settings, on the left-hand side Select “Developer settings”
- Then Select “Personal access tokens”
- Generate a new token.
- Select all the Permissions available
- Once all the permissions are selected Click on Generate Token Button 
- Your personal access token will be displayed.
- This token can be used in place of a password. 
- Click on the blue copy icon (clipboard) to copy your token. 

Put it in a password manager that you'll have to open any time you want to use Github from now on.

Voila! You now have an extra step to perform every time you want to just push something. Isn't that great?
