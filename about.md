I'm a software developer who has been writing programs since the age of 12. I am currently developing Fire Station Alerting Software that helps get first responders get out the door, informed, and on site as quickly as possible. I'm always curious, and I've always got my eye out to learn something new. I also like to share what I know with anyone who wants to get excited with me.

I am always on the lookout for work that is interesting and does good in the world. I'm confident that I can earn a paycheck anywhere, but if your business develops exciting software that has a positive impact on society, then I am definitely interested in working for you.

I spend a portion of my free time expanding my knowledge of various technologies. I have a large backlog of ideas and projects to work on, and I tend to iterate over them all as my interest moves from one to the other and back again.
